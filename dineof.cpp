 * Description: The core file contains DINEOF algorithm. The current file is an realization of the
 *              DIENEOF algorithm. It is an realization of the algorithm proposed in DINEOF (ref1)
 *              
 *              This algorithm has been shown to accurately determine Empirical Orthogonal Funct-
 *              ions from gappy data sets that are used for data reconstructions. The return of
 *              the method will is a fully interpolatede matrix which can then be subjected to a
 *              final EOF decomposition.
